# Horoscope for Leo on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Leo

**Prediction:**

You should wake up feeling balanced and spiritually refreshed, blessed Lion, as the Aries moon aligns with empowering Pluto. Just be mindful to pace yourself when chasing these good vibes, or a harsh connection between Mercury and Chiron could cause you to take on too much at once. Take a breather from superficial friendships when the quarter moon aspects Jupiter midafternoon, going where you feel understood on a philosophical level. This energy also promotes self-reflection and meditation. Draw lines to focus on your own needs and passions when Venus blows a kiss to Mars tonight. Seek guidance from your higher power before heading to bed when the Nodes of Fate stir.
