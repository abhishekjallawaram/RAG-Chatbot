# Horoscope for Aries on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Aries

**Prediction:**

Luna makes her debut into your sign early this morning, dearest Aries, forming a supportive connection with Pluto that's sure to help you make an impression wherever you go. Stay true to yourself when Mercury and Chiron form a harsh square, but avoid acting stubbornly out of habit. The quarter moon aligns with Jupiter midafternoon, amplifying your voice while intensifying emotions. Be mindful of your words during this time, especially if you're feeling particularly sensitive. Seek restorative activities from the comfort of home to reclaim your internal fire when Venus and Mars connect this evening. Meanwhile, the Nodes of Fate stir, asking you to consider what comes next for you.
