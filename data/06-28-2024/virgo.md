# Horoscope for Virgo on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Virgo

**Prediction:**

You should wake up feeling lighter and physically well, Virgo, thanks to a sweet connection between the Aries moon and Pluto early this morning. Hold onto these vibes by making healthy decisions throughout the day. Don't be afraid to swim against the tides when Mercury and Chiron square off, especially if your peers begin acting in negative or unsavory ways. Focus on cultivating connections with composed and success-oriented companions later today when the quarter moon aspects Jupiter, bringing luck to your social sphere. Invest in your spirituality and sense of philosophical community when Venus and Mars align tonight.
