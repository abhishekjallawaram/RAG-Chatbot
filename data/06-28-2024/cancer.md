# Horoscope for Cancer on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Cancer

**Prediction:**

Pay attention to any peculiar dreams that found you early this morning, dearest Cancer, as a sweet connection between the Aries moon and Pluto could reveal new paths toward success or transformation. Be mindful of how you speak to yourself when Mercury and Chiron square off, releasing self-doubt or restrictive points of view. Give yourself space to reflect on long-term goals when the quarter moon aligns with Jupiter later today, presenting opportunities to expand the mind while reaching for more. Invest in new friendships when Venus and Mars align tonight, elevating your charisma and desire to be seen.
