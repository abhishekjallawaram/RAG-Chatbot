# Horoscope for Capricorn on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Capricorn

**Prediction:**

You should feel grounded in your feelings when you awaken, darling Capricorn, thanks to a sweet exchange between the Aries moon and Pluto. Unfortunately, other people's burdens could take away from your sense of peace when Mercury and Chiron square off, making it important that you implement healthy boundaries to protect your own heart. Invest in a healthy home life when the quarter moon aspects Jupiter later today, and don't hesitate to ask for more help from family if you need it. Passions stir tonight when Venus blows a kiss to Mars, marking the ideal time to turn up the heat with someone you adore.
