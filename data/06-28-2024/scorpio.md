# Horoscope for Scorpio on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Scorpio

**Prediction:**

Focus on your health as Luna enters Aries and aspects Pluto early this morning, dearest Scorpio, asking you to nurture the mind, body, and spirit. Meanwhile, Mercury and Chiron square off in our skies, making it important that you get organized within your most aspirational dreams. If you have a habit of taking on too much or leaving projects unfinished, use this energy to correct such behaviors. Be mindful of your commitments when the quarter moon aspects Jupiter, investing only in that which elevates your life. Good vibes flow tonight when Venus and Mars align, bringing spiritual depth to your relationships.
