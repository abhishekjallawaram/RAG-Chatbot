# Horoscope for Pisces on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Pisces

**Prediction:**

Luna migrates into Aries and aspects Pluto early this morning, sweet Pisces, ushering in profound and psychically charged dreams. Just be mindful to reconnect with the present once you've awakened, or a harsh square between Mercury and Chiron could cause you to feel disenchanted with the blessings surrounding you. Invest in your emotional well-being by nurturing yourself and loved ones later today when the quarter moon aspects glittering Jupiter. Good vibes flow tonight when Venus blows a kiss to Mars, igniting passions while conjuring your flirtatious side. Meanwhile, the Nodes of Fate activate, asking you to follow through on your commitments.
