# Horoscope for Gemini on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Gemini

**Prediction:**

Luna enters Aries and aspects Pluto this morning, darling Gemini, putting you in touch with collective consciousness. Use this energy to focus on the good in this world, setting boundaries with toxic new stories or social media feeds when Mercury and Chiron square off. Luck is on your side when the quarter moon rises later this afternoon, though frustrations could emerge if you disconnect from the beauty surrounding you. Luckily, Venus and Mars join forces to help you feel revitalized and full of love this evening, especially when you find your gratitude and embrace personal passions.
