# Horoscope for Sagittarius on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Sagittarius

**Prediction:**

Strange dreams could lead to creative breakthroughs early this morning, Sagittarius, as Luna enters Aries and aspects profound Pluto. Just be mindful to believe in yourself as Mercury and Chiron square off, which could cause your confidence to waiver. Luckily, the quarter moon aspects Jupiter later today, urging you to invest in radical self-love. This energy could also bring interesting developments to matters of the heart, though you should think carefully before entering new commitments. Focus on your habits when Venus and Mars join forces tonight, considering how you can make more time for wellness, fun, and art.
