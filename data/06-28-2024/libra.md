# Horoscope for Libra on Yesterday

**Date:** June 28, 2024

**Sign:** Libra

**Prediction:**

Luna migrates into Aries and aspects Pluto early this morning, dearest Libra, elevating your confidence while expanding the heart. Lean into the vibes by being your most authentic self, investing only in those who love you as you are. Try not to get frustrated if you encounter a few emotional walls, as a harsh square between Mercury and Chiron could lead to moody or stoic demeanors. Luckily, the ambiance elevates when the quarter moon aligns with Jupiter later today, though you'll want to keep the conversation light and harmonious. New commitments or long-term romantic goals could find you tonight when Venus and Mars align.
