# Horoscope for Scorpio on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Scorpio

**Prediction:**

Get organized within your manifestation goals early this morning, dearest Scorpion, as the Aries moon aligns with Venus. Now is also a good time to connect with your spirituality and wellness game, finding ways to support yourself for whatever the future holds. Signs and synchronicities may guide you within matters of the heart when Mercury aspects Uranus, while sweet gestures could reveal a new admirer. Focus on shedding stress that built up over the workweek when Chiron stirs this evening, focusing on what your body needs to reclaim calm. Look for opportunities to expand the mind later tonight once Luna and Mercury align.
