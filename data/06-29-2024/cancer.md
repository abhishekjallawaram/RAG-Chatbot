# Horoscope for Cancer on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Cancer

**Prediction:**

You may be forced to contend with self-restrictive patterns early this morning, dearest Cancer, as the Aries moon squares off with Venus. Luckily, Mercury and Uranus align to lend aid, helping you regain confidence through the support of your peers. Use this energy to spend some time socializing and immerse yourself in supportive communities and friendship circles. You'll have a chance to make peace with obstacles on the path ahead when Luna unites with Chiron this evening, helping you formulate new long-term goals. Just be mindful to pace yourself when Mercury becomes agitated tonight, or you could end up putting too much pressure on yourself.
