**Prediction:**

Pay attention to any strange dreams early this morning, dearest Libra, as the Aries moon and Venus join forces to reveal restrictions within your life. Luckily, you'll have a chance to strategize your way out of any corners you've been stuck in, thanks to a helping hand from Mercury and Uranus. Use this energy to face challenges with logical thinking, bringing your own perspective into the mix. Find healing through your most supportive relationships when Chiron stirs this evening, and be sure to send some extra love to those you hold dear. Just be mindful not to test other people's boundaries when Luna and Mercury square off tonight.
