# Horoscope for Aquarius on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Aquarius

**Prediction:**

Your weekend kicks off with a busy start as the Aries moon squares Venus, Aquarius, but try not to rush through important tasks or errands. Check in with your physical and mental needs as Mercury and Uranus align, shifting your plans to make room for wellness. Think positive thoughts as evening rolls in and Luna cozies up with Chiron, presenting opportunities to heal and lift the spirits. This energy also pairs well with a bit of socializing, so be sure to choose good company. Outline a plan of action for the rest of your weekend when Mercury activates later tonight.
