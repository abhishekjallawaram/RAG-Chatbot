# Horoscope for Virgo on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Virgo

**Prediction:**

Shed the work week by avoiding your screens early this morning, Virgo, as the Aries moon and Venus square off. Instead, look for opportunities to immerse yourself in spiritual community when Mercury and Uranus align, kicking off the weekend with a yoga class, religious services, or meditation session. This celestial exchange opens the door to divine inspiration, helping to unlock your intuitive side. Healing vibes flow when Luna and Chiron unite this evening, especially when you choose to let go of that which does not serve you. Review your social connections when Mercury becomes agitated tonight, cutting ties with toxic dynamics.
