# Horoscope for Gemini on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Gemini

**Prediction:**

Try to ground and appreciate your surroundings before immersing yourself in screens, dearest Gemini, as the Aries moon squares off with Venus. You'll find much to feel grateful for when Mercury and Uranus align, helping you see the connectivity between you and the natural world. If possible, spend some time in quiet reflection while immersed in the great outdoors. Find healing through your social sphere this evening when Luna and Chiron unite, strengthening your sense of community. Just be sure to pull back and clear the mind before heading to bed, or an agitated Mercury could make it difficult to sleep.
