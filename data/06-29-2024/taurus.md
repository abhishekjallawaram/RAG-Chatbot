# Horoscope for Taurus on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Taurus

**Prediction:**

The Aries moon and Venus square off early this morning, darling Taurus, threatening to disrupt your sleep with cerebral or intense dreams. Luckily, you'll have a chance to shake off slumber and reconnect with clarity as Mercury and Uranus align, especially when you are authentic to yourself. This cosmic climate also aids your intelligence, helping you conjure ingenious ideas and solutions, so be sure to brainstorm where you need it most. Healing vibes flow when Chiron stirs this evening, especially when you take a few moments for solitude. Just be mindful not to isolate yourself when Mercury becomes agitated later tonight.
