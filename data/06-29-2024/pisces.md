# Horoscope for Pisces on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Pisces

**Prediction:**

Don't waste time on people who make you feel inferior, dearest Pisces, as the Aries moon squares off with Venus. Luckily, you'll have a chance to break free from negativity and fully embrace fun as Mercury and Uranus align, encouraging you to do something exciting with your closest companions. This cosmic climate also strengthens your creative muscles, helping you make headway within passion projects. Treat yourself to a bit of luxury when Luna and Chiron unite this evening, finding healing through the senses. Try to curb self-doubt later tonight when Mercury becomes agitated, threatening to test your confidence.
