# Horoscope for Aries on Today

**Date:** June 29, 2024

**Sign:** Aries

**Prediction:**

The moon moves through your sign, Aries, forming a harsh square with Venus that may trigger emotional dreams or restless sleep. Luckily, you'll have a chance to reclaim brilliance as Mercury and Uranus align, especially when you draw inspiration from nature while connecting with your gratitude. Now is also a good time to nurture loved ones with kind gestures. Just be mindful to focus on yourself when Luna aligns with Chiron this evening, asking you to consider where healing is needed most. Watch your mood later tonight when Mercury becomes frustrated, threatening to trigger resentment or agitation.
