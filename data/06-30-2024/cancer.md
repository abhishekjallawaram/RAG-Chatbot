# Horoscope for Cancer on Tomorrow

**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Sign:** Cancer

**Prediction:**

Find time for friendship as the moon migrates into Taurus, dearest Cancer, asking you to find footing within your community. Just be mindful to avoid jealous or possessive people when Pluto becomes agitated, or you could find yourself immersed in conflict. Check in with your online profile as the hours continue to unfold, purging outdated posts or photos. If you're hoping to gain more followers, use this energy to brainstorm new and engaging content. You'll have a chance to steal the spotlight later tonight when the sun and moon align, helping you stand out amongst a sea of faces.
