# Horoscope for Taurus on Tomorrow

**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Sign:** Taurus

**Prediction:**

Your dreams could reveal new paths on the horizon, Taurus, as Luna takes her final steps through Aries and your solar twelfth house. Focus on the present while reconnecting with personal goals once you've awakened and the moon migrates into your sign. Try not to let obstacles dissuade you from boldly pursuing what you desire when Pluto becomes agitated, threatening to unravel your long-term goals. Set boundaries with any people, situations, or thoughts that cause you to pull back. New ideas emerge later tonight when the sun and moon align, especially when you collaborate with friends.
