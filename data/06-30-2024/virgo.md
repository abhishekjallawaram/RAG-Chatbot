# Horoscope for Virgo on Tomorrow

**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Sign:** Virgo

**Prediction:**

Good vibes carry you through the remainder of the weekend, sweet Virgo, as the moon enters Taurus and your solar ninth house. Meanwhile, Pluto stirs to encourage organization and wellness, asking you to consider what needs changing so you can access your best life. Work closely with your spirituality to make the most of these vibes, reaching for more while trusting that the universe has your back. Just be mindful that sometimes sacrifices are needed as you seek new horizons. Your wisdom will be a hot commodity later tonight when the sun and moon align, allowing your star to rise.
