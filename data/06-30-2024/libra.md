# Horoscope for Libra on Tomorrow

**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Sign:** Libra

**Prediction:**

Focus on what you can let go of as the moon migrates into Taurus and aspects Pluto, dearest Libra, offering celestial reinforcements regarding release. Empowerment can be found when you replace grief or fear with hope and optimism, though it may take some spiritual heavy lifting to get where you want to be. Consider working with a creative outlet to reclaim a sense of self if you could use some extra support. Your thoughts turn to long-term goals and the people you can build alongside when the sun and moon align tonight.
