# Horoscope for Leo on Tomorrow

**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Sign:** Leo

**Prediction:**

Your responsible side creeps in as the moon enters Taurus, darling Leo, asking you to focus on the foundations that build up to long-term goals. Tensions could brew within matters of the heart if you and your sweetie aren't on the same page due to a harsh connection between Luna and Pluto. If necessary, set boundaries with romantic or social distractions to focus more deeply on your own path toward success. Cap off your weekend with solitude and soul searching when the sun and moon align tonight, opening the doors to enlightenment so you can shed unhealthy patterns.
